# NEML2 Language Features

Language features for NEML2 input files with extension ".nm".

## Supported features

- Formatting
- Hover over text

## Forked from idaholab/moose-language-support

This is a fork of [idaholab/moose-language-support](https://github.com/idaholab/moose-language-support). The extension's language server discovery logic is heavily inspired by the upstream. Features such as code snippets and action parameter autocompletion are removed since they are not relevant to NEML2 input files. Syntax highlighting is separated out as a standalone extension ([neml2-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/applied-material-modeling/neml2-syntax-highlighting)).

## Known Issues

Autocompletion is under development.
